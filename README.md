Optimal Probes is a software package to predict the smallest set of residue pairs for site-directed spin labeling for DEER/EPR experiments that best capture the slowest dynamics in a protein of interest. It uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulation datasets and a hyperparameter optimization strategy for a Markov state model (MSM). 

The Optimal Probes Software source code is available upon request.
